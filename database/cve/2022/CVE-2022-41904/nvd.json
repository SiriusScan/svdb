Prior to version 1.9.7, events encrypted using Megolm for which trust could not be established did not get decorated accordingly (with warning shields). Therefore a malicious homeserver could inject messages into the room without the user being alerted that the messages were not sent by a verified group member, even if the user has previously verified all group members. This issue has been patched in Element iOS 1.9.7. There are currently no known workarounds."
