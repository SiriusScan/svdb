This vulnerability is due to improper handling of undefined command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted command on the CLI or by submitting a crafted HTTPS request to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module. Note: To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative access to the Cisco ASA. A user who has administrative access to a particular Cisco ASA is also expected to have administrative access to the ASA FirePOWER module that is hosted by that Cisco ASA."
