A bug in password \u0026 email change confirmation code allowed an attacker to change their RubyGems.org account's email to an unowned email address. Having access to an account whose email has been changed could enable an attacker to save API keys for that account, and when a legitimate user attempts to create an account with their email (and has to reset password to gain access) and is granted access to other gems, the attacker would then be able to publish and yank versions of those gems. Commit number 90c9e6aac2d91518b479c51d48275c57de492d4d contains a patch for this issue."
