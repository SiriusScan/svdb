Notes: This candidate was assigned to a \"head-reading\" bug in a component of fetchmail 6.2.4 and earlier, which was claimed to allow a denial of service.  However, the bug is in a broken component of fetchmail that is not \"reachable\" by any execution path, so it cannot be triggered by any sort of attack and is not exploitable"
