Continued receipt of these packets causes a sustained denial of service. This issue can only be triggered when CFM hasn't been configured.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\nAll versions prior to 19.1R3-S10 on MX Series;\n19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S7 on MX Series;\n19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S8 on MX Series;\n19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S12 on MX Series;\n20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions on MX Series;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S7 on MX Series;\n20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions on MX Series;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S7 on MX Series;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5 on MX Series;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S4 on MX Series;\n21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4 on MX Series;\n21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3 on MX Series;\n22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S2 on MX Series;\n22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3 on MX Series;\n22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2, 22.3R3 on MX Series;\n22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2 on MX Series.\n"
