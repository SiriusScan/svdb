          "value": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10000 Series allows a network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIf a specific valid IP packet is received and that packet needs to be routed over a VXLAN tunnel, this will result in a PFE wedge condition due to which traffic gets impacted. As this is not a crash and restart scenario, this condition will persist until the system is rebooted to recover.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10000:\n20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S5;\n21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4;\n21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S1;\n22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3;\n22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2;\n22.3 versions prior to 22.3R1-S2, 22.3R2.\n"
