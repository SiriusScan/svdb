The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underling operating system with privileges of the web-based management application, which is running as a restricted user. This could result in changes being made to pages served by the web-based management application impacting the integrity or availability of the web-based management application."
