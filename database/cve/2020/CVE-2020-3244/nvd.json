The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user traffic going through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the traffic classification rules and potentially avoid being charged for traffic consumption."
