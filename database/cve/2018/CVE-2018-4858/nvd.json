          "value": "A vulnerability has been identified in IEC 61850 system configurator (All versions \u003c V5.80), DIGSI 5 (affected as IEC 61850 system configurator is incorporated) (All versions \u003c V7.80), DIGSI 4 (All versions \u003c V4.93), SICAM PAS/PQS (All versions \u003c V8.11), SICAM PQ Analyzer (All versions \u003c V3.11), SICAM SCC (All versions \u003c V9.02 HF3). A service of the affected products listening on all of the host's network interfaces on either port 4884/TCP, 5885/TCP, or port 5886/TCP could allow an attacker to either exfiltrate limited data from the system or to execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted network request to the vulnerable service and a user interacting with the service's client application on the host. In order to execute arbitrary code with Microsoft Windows user permissions, an attacker must be able to plant the code in advance on the host by other means. The vulnerability has limited impact to confidentiality and integrity of the affected system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue."
